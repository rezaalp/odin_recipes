        Authentic Chicken Nanban recipe, made with fried chicken coated in a crispy egg batter that's soaked in a sweet and sour nanban sauce. 
    </h2>
    <strong>
    <ul>
        <h2>MAIN INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <li>450 grams boneless skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 jumbo egg</li>
        <h2>NANBAN SAUCE</h2>
        <li>2 tablespoon susukuchi soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sake</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
       

    </ul>
</strong>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare the tartar sauce, add the boiled egg, celery, scallion, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon zest, and lemon juice to a bowl and stir to combine. Add salt and white pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>To make the nanban sauce, add the soy sauce, sake, sugar and ginger to a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Continue boiling for 1 minute and then turn off the heat and stir in the vinegar.</li>
        <li>Add 2-inches of oil to heavy bottomed pot and heat to 340 degrees F (170 C) and prepare a wire rack and pan.</li>
        <li>Trim any excess fat off the chicken and lightly salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg in a bowl until uniform and then dip the chicken in the egg to thoroughly coat.</li>
        <li>Gently lower the egg coated chicken skin-side down into the hot oil and then drizzle a little of the remaining egg onto the tops of each piece of chicken. The egg will quickly “bloom” and spread out.</li>
        <li>Use tongs or chopsticks to fold the egg back over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken until it's golden brown and cooked through (about 6-8 minutes). You'll want to flip the chicken over a few times, but be careful not to break the crust off off the chicken.</li>
        <li>Dip the fried chicken in the sauce, flipping it over a few times to coat it evenly.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve the chicken with the tartar sauce.</li>
    </ol>
